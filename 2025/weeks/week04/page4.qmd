title: "🗓️ Week 04 -Automating (functional programming)"
---

The aim of this week is to introduce students to more advanced programming, such as familiarity with conditional flow (e.g. if-else conditionals) and creating functions to automate some common tasks for data wrangling and plotting. Students will be shown how they can use these functions in data science projects to make their project workflow more efficient.

## ✍️ Lab Materials

🚧 Students will be asked to use computational tools to automate repeated things in their entire R workflow (e.g. wrangling, visualisation).🚧
