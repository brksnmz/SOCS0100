## Weekly topics

🗓️ **Week 1: Introduction to Computational Social Science**

Introduction to computational social science and open science: data and code sharing, project management, and collaborations -- the use of git and GitHub. This week students will be introduced how they can set up their own GitHub account and subscribe to the module organisation to engage with both individual and group assignments throughout the module.

💻 **Problem set:**

Students will be working with real world datasets to complete a series of data wrangling tasks through Tidyverse packages.

🗓️ **Week4: Automating (functional programming)**

The aim of this week is to introduce students to more advanced programming, such as familiarity with conditional flow (e.g. if-else conditionals) and creating functions to automate some common tasks for data wrangling and plotting. Students will be shown how they can use these functions in data science projects to make their project workflow more efficient.

## Teams

You will be assigned to a team at the beginning of the term.

All team members are expected to contribute to the completion of the lab practicals.You are expected to make use of the provided GitHub repository as the central collaborative platform.

## Assessment

You will be assessed for this module through two assessments each worth 50%. The details of the assessments are below. The assessment briefs will be released in due time with detailed instructions and tasks.

| Assessment   | Length     | \% Final grade | Deadline       |
|--------------|------------|----------------|----------------|
| Assignment 1 | 1500 words | 50             | 4 Nov 25, 1pm  |
| Assignment 2 | 1500 words | 50             | 12 Jan 26, 1pm |

Planning, time-management and the meeting of deadlines are part of the personal and professional skills expected of all students. For this reason, UCL expects students to submit all coursework by the published deadline date and time.

If a student experiences something, which prevents them from meeting a deadline that is sudden, unexpected, significantly disruptive and beyond their control, they should apply for an Extenuating Circumstances (EC) on Portico. If the request is accepted, the student may be granted an extension.

## Course policies

### Academic integrity

Writing assignments can be both an enjoyable and challenging experience. One aspect of writing that students often struggle with is plagiarism: the unacknowledged presentation of a person's thoughts, words, artefacts or software as though they were their own original work. It is even possible to plagiarise yourself if you are citing a work you submitted elsewhere. Direct quotations from published or unpublished works (including internet sources) must always be clearly identified as such by being placed inside quotation marks, and a full reference to their source must be provided in the proper form, including the page reference. Equally, if a student summarises another person's ideas or judgements, they must refer to that person in the text, and include the work to which they have referred in the bibliography. Failure to observe these rules may result in an allegation of plagiarism.

### Collaboration policy

Only work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively.

-   The *summative* assessments must be completed individually and you are welcome to discuss the assignment with classmates at a high level (e.g., discuss what's the best way for approaching a problem, what functions are useful for accomplishing a particular task, etc.). However, you should not directly share answers (including any code) with anyone other than myself.

### AI-usage policy

In this module/assignment, students are permitted to use ChatGPT for specific defined processes within the assessment.

This can be utilised to enhance and support the development of specific skills in specific ways, as specified by the module leader and required by the assessment. As per the requirements, for instance, students are asked to use ChatGPT for critically evaluating their code in automated data collection, data processing, and creating interactive dashboards in this assessment. In doing so, students are expected to highlight instances where ChatGPT offers insightful solutions, refined code, or worsens student's solutions and code.

**Except critical engagement with ChatGPT through code refinement, this module prohibits all other use of artificial intelligence (AI)**, including large language models, to author or co-author formative or summative work. This prohibition includes the following practices and any practices similar to them:

-   Writing parts or all of an assessment;
-   Generating outlines, structures and high-level arguments for essays;
-   Rewriting or paraphrasing text from other sources for use in written work.

Language and writing review are not prohibited, defined as having a third-party or software check areas of academic writing such as structure, fluency, presentation, grammar, spelling, punctuation, and language translation. However, language review may be considered Academic Misconduct if substantive changes to content have been made by the reviewer or software or at their recommendation, which would suggest that the reviewer or software had either produced or determined the substantive content of the work.

Including content generated by AI tools will not be considered academic misconduct only if it is clearly signposted (by, for example, quotation marks) and attributed (by including a reference to the tool and date of use). However, similarly to quoting Wikipedia, quoting an AI system is unlikely to be a valuable addition to your work and unless clearly relevant to an argument may negatively impact the perceived quality of your work.

Suspected use of AI technologies other than specified one in the assessment may lead students to be subject to an Investigatory Viva.

### Late submission policy

The due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material. However, I understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Here are the rules for late submissions:

-   *Assignments* may be submitted up to 2 working days late. There will be a 10 percentage points deduction or one Letter Grade, yet no lower than 40% or Grade D. If it is submitted up to 2-5 working days late, mark is capped at 40% or Grade D. If it is submitted more than 5 working days late, you receive a mark of 1% or Grade E.

If there are important circumstances that prevent you from completing an assignment by the stated due date, you should apply to an Extenuating Circumstances (EC) on Portico before the deadline.
